# Network Analysis on Cocktail Ingredient Data

This notebook represents a novel network analysis on a data set of cocktail ingredients (https://www.kaggle.com/ai-first/cocktail-ingredients). The network is constructed using drinks as nodes and shared ingredients between nodes as edges. The conducted analysis is heavily centered around performing a community detection on the constructed network and analyzing the properties of the obtained communities with respect to other features of the original data.
